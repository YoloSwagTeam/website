            <p><span class="yoloswagteam">YoloSwagTeam</span> is an
            experimental collective whose purpose is to
            share the maintainership of small FOSS projects to avoid the burden
            of being alone while doing this and having your users frustrated in
            result because you aren't always available. Also strength comes
            from the group.</p>

            <p>It is directly inspired from
            <a href="https://jazzband.co/" target="_blank">jazzband</a> but
            mostly differs in the kind of projects and the kind of people in it.</p>

            <p>Because together we are stronger.</p>

        <h1><span class="yoloswagteam">How To Join</span></h1>

        <div class="panel">
            <p>If you consider joining, if you haven't done so while reading
            the whole website to make your decision, please read the
            <a href="#coc">Code of Conduct</a> before doing so, you'll be
            following it.</p>

            <h3>How to join</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>either open a ticket on the <a href="https://github.com/yoloswagteam/website">github repository</a> of this website or ask on <a href="#social">IRC</a> or <a href="#social">Matrix</a></li>
                <li>maybe tell a bit about your motivations (can simply be "I want to help")</li>
                <li>once you are accepted you'll become member of the <a href="https://github.com/yoloswagteam">github organisation</a> and be able to contribute</li>
                <li>then either <a href="https://github.com/YoloSwagTeam/website/blob/master/index.html">send a pull request</a> yourself on this website to add yourself to the member list (or directly push the code if you feel comfortable doing this) or ask someone on the <a href="#social">social places</a> to do it for you if it's not something you are used to</li>
                <li>congratulations, you are now a member of <span class="yoloswagteam">YoloSwagTeam</span> :)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How to include your project</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>first, consider if your project is interesting for this organisation: it must be a FOSS project with users and a certain utility for which you wish to share the maintainership</li>
                <li>if you have a doubt, just ask other members on the <a href="#social">social places</a></li>
                <li>you might want to add a specific <a href="#guidelines">Guidelines.md</a> to your project to overwrite parts of the default <i>Guidelines.md</i> for some specific situations</li>
                <li>make sure that the project has a good README and that it's easy to contribute to it, you want us to be all able to co-helper ourselves</li>
                <li>then, just migrate your project to the organisation</li>
                <li>and add a reference to <span class="yoloswagteam">YoloSwagTeam</span> in the README saying that it's following to rules of this organisation now (including the <a href="#coc">CoC</a>)</li>
                <li>and of course you need to be a member of <span class="yoloswagteam">YoloSwagTeam</span> for that :)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h1><span class="yoloswagteam" id="social">Social places</span></h1>

        <div class="panel">
            <p class="no-indent">Right now, two social places exist for the community to interact:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>an IRC channel: <i>irc.freenode.net#yoloswagteam</i></li>
                <li>a matrix room: <a href="https://riot.im/app/#/room/#YoloSwagTeam:matrix.org" target="_blank">#YoloSwagTeam:matrix.org</a></li>
            </ul>

            <p class="no-indent">
            Both are connected using Matrix bridge so you can join either of
            those depending on your preference and you'll be able to reach the
            same people.

        <div class="panel">
            <p class="no-indent">The first rule of the guidelines is: <b>you are legitimate</b> to co-maintain other projects (yes.)</p>

            <p class="no-indent">Here are the general rules that - unless stated otherwise in the Rules.md (if it exists) - you can feel confident to follow:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    be benevolent, we are all doing this on our free time, we
                    have various levels of knowledge, people will make mistakes, you
                    will make mistakes, we all do, the only people who don't
                    are the ones who do nothing, so: never blame people for their
                    mistakes, fix them, teach them and think about how to avoid
                    that in the future (write tests?).
                </li>
            <ul>
                <p></p>
            </ul>
                <li>for small bug fixes, typo and the likely, the path is free, just do them</li>
                <li>for the pull requests of the same kind, the same recommendations applies</li>
                <li>for minor/trivial features (like add a
                    <code>--debug</code>), if other people generally involved
                    are around check with them if it's ok, if you don't have
                    answers after a few days, feel free to merge</li>
                <li>for significant features/modifications, try to get the approval of people before merging it and try to get to a consensus, if possible, announce your intent to work on it</li>
                <li>for big features/modifications/refactoring (like major rewriting), try to get the approval of others <b>before</b> going into it too much</li>
                <li>again, if no one is around or available for a significant period of time: you are the maintainer, act like it</li>
                <li>and do what you can when you want, we are all volunteers, the idea is to share to weight of maintainership</li>
            </ul>
